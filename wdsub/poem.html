        Go placidly amid the noise and the haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.<br> As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons.<br><br>

Speak your truth quietly and clearly;<br> And listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant;<br> They too have their story.<br><br>

Avoid loud and aggressive persons; <br>They are vexatious to the spirit.<br> If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain or bitter, for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself.<br><br>

Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans.<br> Keep interested in your own career, however humble;<br> It is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.<br><br>

Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery.<br> But let this not blind you to what virtue there is;<br> Many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism.<br><br>

Be yourself.<br> Especially do not feign affection.<br> Neither be cynical about love;<br> For in the face of all aridity and disenchantment, it is as perennial as the grass.<br><br>

Take kindly the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth.<br><br>

Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune.<br> But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings.<br> Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.<br><br>

Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself.<br> You are a child of the universe no less than the trees and the stars;<br> You have a right to be here.<br>And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.<br><br> 
        
Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be.<br> And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.<br> With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.<br> Be <span style="text-decoration: underline; font:italic normal bold large 'playwrite nz basic';color: yellow">cheerful</span>.<br> Strive to be <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: large; color:yellow; font-style:italic; font-weight: bold; font-variant:normal">happy</span>.<br>
